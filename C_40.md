# Topic Player Rank

## Goal 

* Store rank of individual players in the game as player property. 
* Display rank of the player when the game ends.

We will be building the leaderboard which ranks the players based on when the players finished the game. 

It will tell who came first, second, third or fourth. 

Can also add the sounds in the game to make it even more cool.

STEP:

1. We can start by adding one more property of each player called - 'rank'. Also we can add something in our database and code that keeps count of the number of players who have finished the game. Can you think of how we can use the rank property and the number of players who have finished the race to display a leaderboard?

2.  clone the code from previous class

3. creates an additional property for each player called "rank" and adds to the constructor of each player.

   ```javascript
   class Player{
     constructor()
     {
       this.rank = null;
     }
   }
   ```

   

4.  change the database to create a new entry for "CarsAtEnd"  which stores the number of cars that have reached the end point.

   CarsAtEnd: 0

5.  write functions - getCarsAtEnd() and a static function updateCarsAtEnd() to get and update the number of cars which have finished the race.
   * Static functions are functions which are common to all objects created using the class.
   * writes static function inside Player class to updateCarsAtEnd.
   * writes a function to getCarsAtEnd.
   * assigns the current rank of the player inside getCarsAtEnd.

```java script
 class Player 
 {
   getCarsAtEnd() {
    database.ref('CarsAtEnd').on("value",(data)=>{
      this.rank = data.val();
    })
  }

  static updateCarsAtEnd(rank) {
    database.ref('/').update({
      CarsAtEnd:rank
    })
  }
}
```

6.  calls the getCarsAtEnd function inside play state.

   ```javascript
   class Game{
     play()
     {
       player.getCarsAtEnd();
     }
   }
   ```

   

   *  When the player crosses the end point, increase the player Rank by 1 and update the database entry for carsAtEnd

```javascript
class Game{
  play()
  {
    if(player.distance > 3860){
      gameState = 2;
      player.rank +=1
      Player.updateCarsAtEnd(player.rank)
    }
   drawSprites();
 
  }
}
```

7. Display the rank of the player when the game ends

   ```java script
   play()
   {
     end(){
       console.log("Game Ended");
       console.log(player.rank);
     }
   }
   
   ```

   

8. Currently our car only moves straight, you could make it move sideways. You could make it collide with other cars and bounce off. We have used p5.play to create sprites in the game. You could have used matter.js and created car characters which could interact with other cars (or other obstacles) in the game using natural laws of physics.

9. Classes from 41 to 48 are going to be very special where you will learn more in-depth about game design and how game designers design the game world.
